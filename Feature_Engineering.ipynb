        "\n",
        "Q.1 What is a parameter?\n",
        "\n",
        "→ In feature engineering, a parameter refers to a user-defined setting or configuration value that controls how a data transformation is applied during the preprocessing stage. Feature engineering involves converting raw data into meaningful features that enhance the performance of machine learning models. Various transformation techniques—such as scaling, encoding & imputing—use parameters to customize how they process data. In summary, a parameter in feature engineering determines the specific behavior or rules for transforming data into model-ready features.\n",

        "Q.2 What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "→\n",
        "1. Correlation:\n",
        "- Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength & direction of a relationship between two variables. It shows how one variable changes in response to another.\n",
        "- The correlation coefficient is usually denoted by r & ranges between -1 & +1.\n",
        "- +1 = perfect positive correlation\n",
        "- 0 = no correlation\n",
        "- -1 = perfect negative correlation.\n",
        "2. Negative Correlation:\n",
        "- A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "- Ex.: If study time & number of errors have a negative correlation, it means more study time leads to fewer errors.\n",
        "- The correlation coefficient (r) in this case would be less than 0, typically close to -1 for strong negative correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "→ Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data & make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. In simple terms, ML enables computers to learn patterns from historical data & improve performance over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main components in ML are as follows:\n",
        "1. Dataset\n",
        "2. Features (Input Variables)\n",

        "Q.4 How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "→ The loss value is a numerical indicator of how well a machine learning model's predictions match the actual outcomes. It measures the error between the predicted output & the true (target) value. The loss value is a critical measure of a model's performance. It helps determine how accurate the predictions are & guides the optimization process to improve the model. A low & decreasing loss usually means a good model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5 What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "→\n",
        "1. Continuous Variables:\n",

        "2. Categorical Variables:\n",
        "- Categorical variables represent groups or categories.\n",
        "- They can take on a limited number of distinct values (also called \"labels\" or \"classes\").\n",
        "- Types of catrgorical variables are Nominal & Ordinal.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q.7 What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "→ In machine learning, a dataset is usually split into two main parts: training and testing sets. This helps evaluate how well a model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
        "1. Training Dataset:\n",
        "- The training dataset is the portion of data used to teach the model.\n",
        "- The model learns patterns, relationships, and rules from this data.\n",

        "2. Testing Dataset:\n",
        "- The testing dataset is the portion of data used to evaluate the trained model.\n",
        "- It contains new data that the model has never seen before.\n",
        "- Helps measure how well the model generalizes to real-world scenarios.\n",
        "- Ex.: After training, the model predicts house prices on the remaining 20% of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8 What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "→ A sklearn.preprocessing is a module in Scikit-learn (a popular Python machine learning library) that provides tools for transforming & preparing data before feeding it into a machine learning model.\n",
        "- It helps in scaling, encoding, normalizing & transforming data so that machine learning models can process it effectively.\n",
        "- It is essential for building accurate & efficient machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 What is a Test set?\n",
        "\n",
        "→ A test set is a portion of the dataset that is kept separate from the training process & is used to evaluate the final performance of a trained machine learning model. It plays a critical role in determining how well the model will perform in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics of Test Set:\n",
        "- Not used during training: The model has never seen this data before.\n",
        "- Used for evaluation only: It helps assess how well the model performs on unseen or real-world data.\n",
        "- Represents future data: Acts as a simulation of how the model will behave in practical use.\n",
