        "**→**\n",
        "- Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence models designed to understand, generate & process human language.\n",
        "- They are trained on massive datasets consisting of books, articles, websites & other textual sources.\n",
        "- LLMs are built using deep learning architectures, primarily the Transformer architecture.\n",
        "- Common ex. of LLMs include GPT, BERT, LLaMA & PaLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions of Large Language Models (LLM's) are as follows:\n",
        "- The transformer model uses a self-attention mechanism, allowing it to capture relationships between words regardless of their position in a sentence.\n",
        "- During training, LLMs learn language patterns by predicting the next word or missing words in a sentence.\n",
        "- LLMs use embeddings to convert text into numerical representations that neural networks can process.\n",
        "- After training, LLMs can generalize across multiple tasks without task-specific retraining.\n",
        "- LLMs are capable of tasks such as text generation, summarization, translation, question answering & conversational AI.\n",
